COMP 310 - File System Assignment

--------------------------------------

This file system should only fail one test: the empty dir check at the very end of Test 2.

I'm not sure why that happens.  The directory actually is empty, it just reports as not empty for some reason.

The size tests will say "If the emulated disk contains just over 71680 bytes, this is OK
".  The actual disk size is 1024 kilobytes.

The first 30 or so kilobytes are reserved for the for the file system metadata (iNodes, etc.).
