Assignment 2 - Andrew Fogarty
=============================

To test, I ran the script found in test-solution.sh.

This script starts Printer 1 with a buffer size of 6 and printer 2 with a buffer size of 7.

The script then boots up 8 clients attached to printer 1 and 8 clients attached to printer 2.
These clients execute in parallel.


Console output:
